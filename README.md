Sublime Text Scala Test
=======================

Overview
--------

  - Run scala unit tests (all tests in suite / single fixture)
  - Switch between code and test
  - Navigate quickly to scala files within project folder

Installation
------------

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory

 - OS X: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages`
 - Windows: `%APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
 - Linux: `~/.Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/`

and clone the repository using the command below:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/patgannon/sublimetext-scalatest.git ScalaTest
```

Settings
--------

You can specify a different path to the Scala executable. By default, you will need to have Scala in your path, which likely means you will need to run Sublime Text 2 from the [command line](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html)

Copy the `ScalaTest.sublime-settings` file to `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User/` and make your changes there.


Usage
-----

 - Run single scala test fixture: `Command-Shift-X`
 - Run all scala tests in the project folder: `Option-Shift-X`
 - Switch between code and test: `Command-Shift-R`
 - Navigate to scala files in project folder (in quick panel): `Command-Shift-E`

Keys:
 'Command' (OSX) = 'Ctrl' (Linux / Windows)

 'Option' (OSX) = 'Alt' (Linux / Windows)


Note
----
This plug-in assumes your project folder is organized as follows:

implementation files are in src/main/scala/[namespace]/[ImplementationClassName].scala

test files are in src/test/scala/[namespace]/[ImplementationClassName]Test.scala

JAR files needed to run tests are either under lib/default or lib/test

If that is not your convention, some of the features won't work.  (Use at your own risk.)  If you make modifications to accomodate your folder structure, go ahead and submit a pull request (bonus points for extensibility!)

Also note that currently this plug-in uses the JUnit test runner.
